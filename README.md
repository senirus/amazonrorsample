# Ruby on Rails
## "hello, world!"
This is the first application developed by me on Ruby on Rails.
My journey with RoR started after I got in to my first internship. There I was assigned to backend development where they used micro-services architecture for the backend. The service I was assigned to was written in very old versions of RoR and I had to start learning RoR from scratch.

Guided by:

Hello, world!
ruby version - 2.6.3
rails version - 6.0.2.1

Currently, the latest ruby version is 'Ruby 3.3.0-rc1' & the latest Rails version is 'Rails 7.1.2'.
Hope to add more features to this project and upgrade to the newest versions of RoR day by day.
